I sit about the same distance as you and have the 83 inch G4. The Bravia 9 is very nice and I almost switched to that but the micro contrast from OLED is just something you can’t live without it once you have it.  I think at 6 feet I wouldn’t go more than 83–85 inch, if you’re at eight or nine, I could see going to 98 but  any closer and that’s going to start to feel overwhelming, especially closeups in movies, and could give you a little bit of motion sickness.  The C5 and 83 inches is probably the best value for an OLED in that size, the G5 is better but significantly more expensive.

My Blu-rays look amazing and so do YouTube videos, and very surprisingly I have never seen better SD picture quality on an HD TV.
