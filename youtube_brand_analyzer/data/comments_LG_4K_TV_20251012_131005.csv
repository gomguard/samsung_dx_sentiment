Of the premium segments, Mini-LEDs offer higher brightness and color volume whereas OLEDs offer better viewing angles and contrast.<br>2. OLEDs tend to suffer a higher rate of Burn-In in hotter areas (more than 40 degrees), so if you are planning to buy a premium TV, and you are from such an area and your living room does not have AC, go for a Mini-LED TV instead of OLED.<br>3. If your budget do not allow for you to get a higher tier version of latest model, go for last year model of that tier, like if Samsung QN90F (2025) is out of budget, opt for QN90D (2024). Yes QN85F (2025) has some features that looks on paper better than QN90D, but 90 series is a higher tier than 85, as such will have more local-dimming zones and better HDR management (in some cases) and so on, which results in better experience. This cannot be followed when choosing mid-range TVs, as the upgrades year-on-year is greater in those segments.<br>4. Hisense Q series, TCL C series are extremely good deals which offer Samsung Mini-LED QLED and Sony Mini-LED levels of performance at lower price bracket. But their other ranges are things to be debated.","Some points that need to be noted:
1. Of the premium segments, Mini-LEDs offer higher brightness and color volume whereas OLEDs offer better viewing angles and contrast.
2. OLEDs tend to suffer a higher rate of Burn-In in hotter areas (more than 40 degrees), so if you are planning to buy a premium TV, and you are from such an area and your living room does not have AC, go for a Mini-LED TV instead of OLED.
3. If your budget do not allow for you to get a higher tier version of latest model, go for last year model of that tier, like if Samsung QN90F (2025) is out of budget, opt for QN90D (2024). Yes QN85F (2025) has some features that looks on paper better than QN90D, but 90 series is a higher tier than 85, as such will have more local-dimming zones and better HDR management (in some cases) and so on, which results in better experience. This cannot be followed when choosing mid-range TVs, as the upgrades year-on-year is greater in those segments.
4. Hisense Q series, TCL C series are extremely good deals which offer Samsung Mini-LED QLED and Sony Mini-LED levels of performance at lower price bracket.
