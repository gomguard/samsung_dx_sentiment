      "title": "Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It)",
      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs? Let me know in the comments.   #samsung #samsungtv #TV #QLED #QLEDTV",

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

      "title": "Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It)",
      "description": "Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code \"SNAZZYLABS\" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of \"Frame\"-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - \"Pro\" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",

      "description": "💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

I actually have the S90D 42 inch and I came from a 48” C1 I noticed less aggressive ASBL (dimming w/ static elements) on the Samsung but I don’t know if that’s improved on the c5 too i imagine it did. The C5 may be a little better than the S90F 42” brightness wise from what I’ve heard. Thank you for your support btw definitely means a lot!",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

If you go Samsung OLED, the power board may go out within the 1 year warranty but I still suggest if spending over $1499, get an extended warranty or buy from Costco etc!! 🎉",

I actually have the S90D 42 inch and I came from a 48” C1 I noticed less aggressive ASBL (dimming w/ static elements) on the Samsung but I don’t know if that’s improved on the c5 too i imagine it did. The C5 may be a little better than the S90F 42” brightness wise from what I’ve heard. Thank you for your support btw definitely means a lot!",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though.

      "comment_text_original": "As an owner of 3 Frame TVs (Non-Pro's from 2020 and 2022) due to the desire of \"TVs that don't look like TVs\". Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can't relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The \"art mode\" is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it's that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I'd ever pay for the \"Pro\" version though. The regular frames were already too expensive for what they are, and I feel like we'd all less harsh on these TVs if the price matched the frustration but it doesn't.",

Bought a Samsung OLED monitor from them last year, and they have the same freakin &quot;smart OS&quot; on their monitors that don&#39;t let you turn off Game Mode from auto-start up (which prevents USB-C ports on the monitor from being used at their full speed) without going through the service menu.

I actually have the S90D 42 inch and I came from a 48” C1 I noticed less aggressive ASBL (dimming w/ static elements) on the Samsung but I don’t know if that’s improved on the c5 too i imagine it did. The C5 may be a little better than the S90F 42” brightness wise from what I’ve heard. Thank you for your support btw definitely means a lot!",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

Anyone looking to buy a 2025 Samsung QLED tv needs to watch this!! 🎉 <br>Also, having just experienced the power board die on my $1600 65qn90C after only 22 months, ANYONE buying a Samsung tv, I STRONGLY suggest getting an extended warranty!!  If you go Samsung OLED, the power board may go out within the 1 year warranty but I still suggest if spending over $1499, get an extended warranty or buy from Costco etc!! 🎉",

Ps5 games look amazing the uhd 4k and oled channels on YouTube is stunning. Just wish i could get a sharper picture in sdr. I think i got my moneys worth.

I actually have the S90D 42 inch and I came from a 48” C1 I noticed less aggressive ASBL (dimming w/ static elements) on the Samsung but I don’t know if that’s improved on the c5 too i imagine it did. The C5 may be a little better than the S90F 42” brightness wise from what I’ve heard. Thank you for your support btw definitely means a lot!",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

If you go Samsung OLED, the power board may go out within the 1 year warranty but I still suggest if spending over $1499, get an extended warranty or buy from Costco etc!! 🎉",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

Ps5 games look amazing the uhd 4k and oled channels on YouTube is stunning. Just wish i could get a sharper picture in sdr. I think i got my moneys worth.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

The one from 2022 was naively purchased by Jimmy and wife thinking Samsung would&#39;ve improved the software. And they did! Sorta, it was still bad, just different bad and just as laggy. Bought a Samsung OLED monitor from them last year, and they have the same freakin &quot;smart OS&quot; on their monitors that don&#39;t let you turn off Game Mode from auto-start up (which prevents USB-C ports on the monitor from being used at their full speed) without going through the service menu. Needless to say, I think I&#39;m going to be leaning away from Samsung displays as new purchases for a while. 😅",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",

The one from 2022 was naively purchased by Jimmy and wife thinking Samsung would&#39;ve improved the software. And they did! Sorta, it was still bad, just different bad and just as laggy. Bought a Samsung OLED monitor from them last year, and they have the same freakin &quot;smart OS&quot; on their monitors that don&#39;t let you turn off Game Mode from auto-start up (which prevents USB-C ports on the monitor from being used at their full speed) without going through the service menu. Needless to say, I think I&#39;m going to be leaning away from Samsung displays as new purchases for a while. 😅",

He said that he saw a couple in the dollar store around the corner 🥵 That jerk-off. \n\nI am glad that I was able to repair my TV for so long, until parts ran out. I purchased the last colour wheel for the LG DLP TV line ever.",

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",
