I hope LG spends more time on the G6 with the release next year and it would be nice if Panasonic would provide a sku that doesn&#39;t have the extra sound and an OS other than Firetv (that is if Panasonic will have a model in the US in 2026).

Also the G5 seems to have memory leaks when streaming local files on the network, I've seen this happen in Emby, Plex, and the built in media player, and it seems to happen more often when viewing (you guessed it) Dolby vision content or another person on reddit found for him it was turning on subtitles . Videos would play fine for anywhere from 5-30 minutes then would start to stutter, audio would drop out for a second here and there, then the tv would black screen and give a message that the app was going to be restarted to free up memory. So far no tv updates have fixed this, I'm currently on Firmware 33.20.69 as I write this, for reference",1000,23,9,,2025-08-22T23:03:04Z,2025-08-22T23:03:04Z,none,True,0.581,positive,0.51,,,2025-10-12T13:09:39.688186

It's very nice but I've noticed some odd localised bright zones that aren't as bright sometimes. Like for instance in your video one side of your white shirt is very noticeably darker than the other sometimes. But then when I watch it back, the massive brightness difference is no longer there. It's really weird.

It also becomes really visible in news shows (or any show that tends to have large solid coloured graphics) where a block of colour that's supposed to be solid will have a noticeable brightness gradient.

I'm not someone who earns a lot of money, but buying an audiovisual product is a passion purchase; I do what's necessary to treat myself and get quality.

To get into the LCD debate, I'd rather get a 65-75-inch Bravia 9 than a 98-inch Hisense or TCL, which aren't at all on par with the Sony in terms of fidelity, upscaling, etc. It's the same price, but my value for money isn't about sacrificing fidelity for screen size.

Again, for the same price or even less, I prefer image fidelity, even if it means going smaller (55, 65, or 77 inches), rather than having an average, so-called immersive rendering at 83, 98, or more than 100 inches.

If you're going to get a 100-120 inch projector, you might as well get a quality video projector (at $3,000, there's a top-notch Epson laser projector and other models), and lower the blinds for a total cinematic immersion.

A while back I had an issue with an 83” A90J.

After about a month of emailing Sony pictures I finally got them to see it and admit it wasn’t normal. So they offered me: Full refund or replacement. At the time, the X95K miniLED was new and exciting. Boasting extreme brightness and awesome local dimming. The 85” offered the most zones and was supposed to have minimal to no blooming at all. So I did it. Immediately upon turning the TV on I saw all of this terrible backlight bleeding into the black screen around the Sony logo. Whatever. I thought it was just that local dimming wasn’t engaged. Boy was I wrong! Some of the worst blooming I ever saw. In the actual content itself, and bleeding out all into the black bars even with local dimming on high. I thought for sure it was defective. Sony couldn’t deny the horrors that were the pictures I sent them, so they replaced it and again - maybe even worse this time - it was plagued with terrible blooming. Went back to OLED on my hands and knees after that. Kissed its feet. Begged for forgiveness and will never look back. I’m just as curious as everyone else to see microLED hit the consumer market.

I thought it was just that local dimming wasn’t engaged. Boy was I wrong! Some of the worst blooming I ever saw. In the actual content itself, and bleeding out all into the black bars even with local dimming on high. I thought for sure it was defective. Sony couldn’t deny the horrors that were the pictures I sent them, so they replaced it and again - maybe even worse this time - it was plagued with terrible blooming. Went back to OLED on my hands and knees after that. Kissed its feet. Begged for forgiveness and will never look back. I’m just as curious as everyone else to see microLED hit the consumer market. Maybe then, but until then, OLED all day long",1528,6,0,,2025-09-19T22:42:07Z,2025-09-19T22:42:07Z,none,True,-0.341,negative,0.534,sony,,2025-10-12T13:09:40.160091

I don't believe OLED will disappear like Plasma.

Some will stop, like Panasonic, but I think LG will continue, Sony will continue, and Samsung too, if there's still market share to be gained.

They may follow Sony's path, mainly downsizing to 55-65 inches (perhaps up to 77 inches), to offer a reasonable price to ensure a certain sales volume, without harming people who are looking for pure OLED quality.

And alongside this, they will develop LCD to offer very large sizes in this technology, at prices close to a ""small"" OLED.

OLED isn't going away; it'll still be around in smartphones, gaming monitors, PCs, cars, etc.

At IFA in Berlin Sony put the B8 II next to the reference monitor in studio demonstration, and the RGB led prototype hidden behind a curtain, they did not put the Bravia 9.

And, TCL has started production of inject-printed OLED, initially in small formats to 2026, and is considering how to enter/position itself in the TV market by 2027 (at very reasonable prices).

I hope the two technologies will continue to coexist and offer the best to consumers.

The G5 delivers more brightness, but not correctly. The yin-yang between very dark and very light isn't optimal.

At first glance, the G5 is more dynamic, but it seems less precise in use.

The color volume also seems better on the C5 (surprisingly).

The details also stand out better.

The G5 looks more like a Tandem RGB prototype that LG hasn't fully mastered than a truly premium TV like the 

B8II, the Z95B, and the S95F. If I had to recommend an LG OLED TV to a friend with a ~2,000€ (£$) budget, I'd say the 55C5 + professional SDR/HDR calibration, rather than the 55G5 straight out of the box.
