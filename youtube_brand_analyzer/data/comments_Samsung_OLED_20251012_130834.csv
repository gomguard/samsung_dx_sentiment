The part of the S95F not having any Dirty Screen Effect is very true for my TV.

Filmmaker mode looks good if you set Picture Clarity: Custom, Judder reduction=5. Without it, panning scenes stutter. If I enable the Blur reduction setting I can bad soap opera affect.
Some people mention that Judder reduction causes artifacts in grass, but I have not noticed that, perhaps I have not looked to closely.

Contrast I turn down from 50 to 47, or else it looks a bit harsh.
Color I turn down from 25 to 24.

I kept ""Peak Brightness: High"" for HDR and ""Peak Brightness: Medium"" for SDR, these are the default settings. If I increase peak brightness for SDR, I see too much grain in the image.

I've kept the light sensor turned on, but you can disable it under General & Privacy->Power and Energy Saving->Brightness Optimization if you want to ensure max brightness.

In Florida, the anti-glare feature is amazing!  Also, at night we can watch movies and when people turn on a light in the kitchen, there is NO reflection.   Also, love the one connect.  With a slim fit wall mount, it looks very clean.  One wire going from TV, down the wall and into the one connect that sits in our media center/TV stand.   Paired with our Samsung Soundbar, which Q Symphony takes up a notch.    We keep in movie or filmmaker mode.  Had to turn off ALL of the smoothing as the Soap Opera effect was just too much for us coming from the older plasma.   Gaming is incredible.   I could care less about the software as we use Apple TV for everything.  I highly recommend this TV for anyone.  If you live in a house with a lot of natural light this is a no brainer.

You've correctly raised the details regarding DV, Tayzen, etc., but their global leadership positions shouldn't encourage them to change course much, lol

Seeing Netflix offering HDR10+, it's more like the market is slowly adapting to them.

I'm not a big fan of Samsung; I've always been a Sony (and a little Panasonic) fan in recent years. But I have to say that the QD OLED mix (with all its positives) and the matte-coated panel really impressed me. The blacks get deeper as light pollution decreases.

For me, blaming Samsung's coating for a lack of contrast is like blaming a movie theater for making us watch a movie in the dark, lol.

I use an Apple TV, so Tayzen doesn't bother me at all.

The main reason I'm not buying a Samsung is because the upscaling is inferior to the others (especially Sony). 

YouTube channels love to rave about HDR performance, but I still watch a lot of programs in SDR, bcs I'm from Paris, and in France we don't have many TV programs (shows, movies, sports, anime) in HDR yet, I have all the Netflix, Amazon Prime or Disney+ subscriptions to have a choice, but in SDR. so it's very important.

You're going to get the B8II; it's an excellent model. Sony could have pushed the brightness further; it's way behind the competition, even though the price isn't 😅

They probably don't want to compete too much with the B9, which remains THE flagship model.

By the way, I'd like you to give us a little bit of your opinion on the market compared to what you've already tested overall, and your specific impression of the Bravia 9 and the Bravia 8 II, because I'm hesitating between the two for my next TV.

My 2020 Oled tv Sony A8H is good, but it's slowly starting to fall behind since the arrival of the Bravia 9 and the QD OLED, lol

Das einbrennen in OLED Displays ist praktisch unmöglich. Es gibt seit mindestens vier Jahren Präventivmethoden, dass ein einbrennen eines OLED Einfach unmöglich macht.

Wenn du dir tatsächlich ein QLED gekauft hast, weil ein OLED sich einbrennen kann, dann hast du einen absolut großen Fehler gemacht

Ich besitze ein OLE vom Jahr 2021 den Sony A 80 J Diesel OLE. Fernseher hat ein Pixel Shift System, was nach dem Ausschalten des Fernsehers beginnt. Demzufolge hat er Präventivmaßnahmen, das ein brennenden, praktisch unmöglich macht.

Ich bin ein Hardcorezocker. Das bedeutet innerhalb von einem Jahr mache ich über 1000 Stunden im Ego Shooter Bereich. Insgesamt sind das wahrscheinlich 1500 Stunden zocken im Jahr
Und dann erklär mir mal bitte, wo sich mein Fernseher eingebrannt hat

Nur Menschen, die keine Ahnung haben, behaupten, dass OLED Fernseher einbrennen und man deswegen ein QLED Fernseher kaufen soll
Die Qualitäts Einbußen, die du da machst, weil du dir kein OLED Fernseher gekauft hast, sind schon enorm und ich spreche aus Erfahrung weil ich habe mir 2018 ein Q LED Fernseher gekauft, nämlich der Q9fn
Der bis dato hellste Quantum Dott Fernseher

Honestly, I wish plasma TVs had continued to advance. Just like OLED, they use emissive pixel technology; however, each pixel was a tiny glass capsule filled with noble gases that would glow when excited with electricity. The glowing incandescent light output of plasma is vastly superior to the LED light output of OLED and Mini-LED. Plasma produced colors that were much richer and more impactful, reminiscent of an oil painting. It&#39;s interesting because OLED has a wider color gamut coverage than plasma; however, plasma has more continuous bands of light across the visible spectrum. On a CIE chart, OLED and Mini-LED show tall, narrow spectral spikes, meaning their light output is concentrated at specific wavelengths, which makes color production a bit harsh and unnatural. Plasma has very smooth, broad, overlapping spectral curves on a CIE chart due to its glowing phosphors. As a result, color production is much more natural and cinematic. A last-gen high-end plasma will still destroy the very best OLED has to offer, but there is a big caveat... only in a dark room environment. Plasma just cannot get very bright, and all of that magic disappears in a bright room.
