m_LCI2rFDUY,The Unstoppable Rise Of LG TVs (There's No Catching Up),"💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

Today we're assessing the 27in model, utilising the same 4K/240Hz Samsung QD-OLED panel as MSI's 272URX and AOC's AG276UZD. It promises up to 1000 nits peak brightness, infinite contrast and near-instant response times, all at the attractive price of just £669 here in the UK.

GWDQ4W1jHGY,Samsung S90F QD-OLED: ANÁLISE COMPLETA + Comparativo C5 e S90D,"🔥Link de compra da S95F (em promoção): https://curt.link/iEtTO 🔥Link de compra da S90F: https://curt.link/dGbMx Cupom: VEMPROCLUBE  📱Entre no nosso Canal de Ofertas: https://linkmc.click/ofertas 📝Entre no nosso grupo de conteúdo: https://linkmc.click/newsmc  Análise completa da nova Samsung S90F, TV OLED da marca coreana que acaba de chegar ao Brasil. O modelo traz a tecnologia QD-OLED, que combina o painel OLED da Samsung (sem subpixel branco) com pontos quânticos, permitindo alcançar picos de brilho de até 1500 nits em janelas de 10% no modo HDR. Isso representa uma melhora considerável em relação à geração anterior, com aproximadamente 30% de ganho em brilho.  A S90F mantém os principais atributos da tecnologia OLED, como o preto super profundo e o contraste infinito, agora acompanhados de um volume de cor muito bacana, resultado da combinação das tecnologias exclusivas da Samsung. Além da imagem, a TV também traz melhorias no som. Conta com áudio de 40W em um sistema 2.1 canais, oferecendo uma experiência sonora mais encorpada. No sistema operacional, a S90F já vem equipada com o novo Tizen 2025, que adota a interface One UI — mesma interface presente nos smartphones da Samsung — e que agora está sendo integrada também aos eletrodomésticos conectados da marca, como parte da estratégia de criar um ecossistema unificado.  Em termos de inteligência artificial, a TV traz mais recursos embarcados graças a um chip mais poderoso. Entre as novidades estão o AI Vision, agora com suporte a karaokê, e o recém anunciado Copilot, que ainda não foi testado, mas representa uma nova funcionalidade que deve chegar em breve. É importante destacar que a S90F não é o modelo topo de linha da Samsung em 2025. Esse título continua com a S95F, que promete alcançar picos de brilho superiores a 2.000 nits.  00:00 - Destaques 02:10 - Design 05:47 - Sistema 10:00 - Qualidade de imagem 17:10 - Esportes 19:12 - Games 22:15 - Áudio 24:23 - Comparativo S90F x C5 e S90D 29:18 - Conclusão  📱 Smartphones recomendados Topo de linha: 𖧹 Galaxy S25 Ultra: https://linkmc.click/gs25u 𖧹 iPhone 16 Pro Max: https://linkmc.click/iph16pm 𖧹 RedMagic 10 Pro: https://linkmc.click/redm10p 𖧹 Xiaomi 15 Ultra: https://linkmc.click/x15u  Intermediários: 𖧹 Galaxy S25: https://linkmc.click/gs25 𖧹 Galaxy A56: https://linkmc.click/ga56 𖧹 iPhone 16: https://linkmc.click/iph16 𖧹 Redmi Note 14: https://linkmc.click/rn14 𖧹 Poco X6 Pro: https://linkmc.click/px6p  De entrada: 𖧹 Galaxy A16: https://linkmc.click/ga16 𖧹 Moto G04s: https://linkmc.click/mg04s 𖧹 Moto G15: https://linkmc.click/mg15 𖧹 iPhone 16e: https://linkmc.click/iph16e 𖧹 Redmi 14C: https://linkmc.click/r14c  📺 Smart TVs: Topo de linha: 𖧹 Samsung Neo QLED QN900D (8K): https://linkmc.click/qn900d 𖧹 Samsung Neo QLED QN90D (4K): https://linkmc.click/qn90d 𖧹 Samsung OLED S90D: https://linkmc.click/s90d 𖧹 LG OLED C4: https://linkmc.click/lgoc4 𖧹 LG OLED G4: https://linkmc.click/lgog4  Intermediárias: 𖧹 Philips The Xtra: https://linkmc.click/xtra 𖧹 Philips The One: https://linkmc.click/theone 𖧹 Samsung QN85D: https://linkmc.click/qn85d  𖧹 LG QNED85: https://linkmc.click/qned85 𖧹 TCL C755: https://linkmc.click/c755  De entrada:  𖧹 TCL C655: https://linkmc.click/c655 𖧹 Samsung QLED Q60D: https://linkmc.click/q60d 𖧹 Samsung DU8000: https://linkmc.click/du8000 𖧹 Samsung The Frame: https://linkmc.click/tframe 𖧹 LG QNED80: https://linkmc.click/qned80  🏷️Produtos AMAZON 𖧹 Echo Pop: https://linkmc.click/echo-pop 𖧹 Echo Dot 5ª geração: https://linkmc.click/echo-dot 𖧹 Echo Show 5: https://linkmc.click/echoshow5 𖧹 Echo Show 8: https://linkmc.click/echoshow8 𖧹 Echo Show 10: https://linkmc.click/echoshow10 𖧹 Echo Show 15: https://linkmc.click/echoshow15 𖧹 Echo Studio: https://linkmc.click/echostudio 𖧹 Fire TV Stick 4K: https://linkmc.click/stick4k 𖧹 Fire TV Stick Full HD: https://linkmc.click/stickfhd 𖧹 Kindle 11ª geração: https://linkmc.click/kindle 𖧹 Kindle Paperwhite: https://linkmc.click/paperwhite 𖧹 Kindle Oasis: https://linkmc.click/oasis 𖧹 Echo Buds 2ª geração: https://linkmc.click/buds2  🚀Drones, gimbals e câmeras de ação: 𖧹 DJI Neo: https://linkmc.click/neo-standard 𖧹 DJI Flip: https://linkmc.click/flip-standard-com-tela 𖧹 DJI Mini 2 SE: https://linkmc.click/mini-2-se 𖧹 DJI Mini 4K: https://linkmc.click/djimini4k 𖧹 DJI Mini 3: https://linkmc.click/mini-3 𖧹 DJI Mini 3 Pro: https://linkmc.click/mini-3-pro 𖧹 DJI Mini 4 Pro: https://linkmc.click/mini-4-pro 𖧹 DJI Air 3S: https://linkmc.click/djiair3s 𖧹 DJI Mavic 3: https://linkmc.click/mavic-3 𖧹 DJI Avata: https://linkmc.click/avata  Acompanhe todo nosso conteúdo em https://mundoconectado.com.br/  Curta nossa página no Facebook! https://facebook.com/MundoConectado/  Siga-nos no Instagram! https://instagram.com/MundoConectadobr  Siga-nos no Twitter! https://twitter.com/MundoConectadoo",2025-09-02T14:00:32Z,BR,@mundoconectado,678000,1635,42105,2186,386,28,6.1085
