Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though.

When you buy a TV for your home, you are not going to place it side by side with another TV (that’s common sense). So, no one can really predict the “perfect” color reproduction in advance.

This is because people perceive colors differently. For example, someone who is color-blind might prefer highly saturated images, while another person may find softer colors more natural.<br><br>That’s why I feel YouTube reviews SHOULDN&#39;T be your only guide.

For many customers who do not like to change products every 4-5 years, that&#39;s a very big deal. The other thing that Sony historically stands out is the sound quality.

Reliability is often more important than features in a TV, especially for most buyers who want a long-lasting and hassle-free experience.<br>Sony is Premium build, great after-sale and very reliable on the other hand  TCL TVS are cheap in price  and customer support can be hit-or-miss and not as premium in build quality  . Your reviews are missing these important things when you are spending money",5,1,2025-10-15T22:44:34Z
