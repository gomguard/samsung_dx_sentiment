Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though.

wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light. So technically, for real world content, qd-oled  (and probably Tandem WOLED) still have higher color gamut.",1,0,2025-08-19T20:15:59Z

I&#39;ve argued with people that said they think the white on woled looks more natural, despite the fact that that&#39;s freaking impossible. Essentially, qd-oled is capable of pure white. I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

OLED still has better black levels and contrast than any of the RGB Mini LEDs and I&#39;ve seen all three: this Samsung, the Hisense and the prototype Sony. RGB MiniLED can produce a wide color gamut, but is only able to hit those 100% of BT.2020 numbers when displaying a single color on the screen. MiniLED TVs like this still suffer from haloing with bright objects on a dark background because there is not a 1-to-1 match between backlight and each pixel. They&#39;re great looking TVs but personally I wouldn&#39;t call them OLED killers. It&#39;s big. It&#39;s bright. It&#39;s colorful. But it&#39;s also $30K.",1,0,2025-09-10T18:13:39Z

Nothing wrong with the W version and it&#39;s still a good tv with nice dark to light contrasts but it might stuggle to be as bright as QLED/LCD tvs but nothing a dark room can&#39;t fix and again it&#39;s just old-ish tech compared to what&#39;s out there right now.",0,0,2025-09-07T23:40:24Z

A “US” car will have components made in Mexico &amp; Canada, and perhaps in Central &amp; South America and Europe &amp; Asia—but assembled in the US. And maybe not even that, these days, but the multinational origin is baked in. Mergers &amp; Aquisitions IS a fact of life—I used to work in a large brokerage firm (IT) on the same floor as our M&amp;E division. So passing brand names around? Yeah, that happens. But it isn’t an sbsolute statement of dismissal either. Sony is still Sony and Samsung is still Samsung (Panasonic was Matsushita 40+ years ago and for all I know still is, but as you observed may have been divested).<br><br>Samsung Display is the sole manufacturer of the QD-OLED display. They sell it—all over. Internally to Samsung electronics, and externally to Sony, LG, Hisense, etc. I don’t know if micro-LED has a sole manufacturing source or is licensed; the cost starting at 6 figures makes it only of academic interest to the likes of me. The new RGB displays may be a different matter as that new technology has just become commercially viable for 2026. QD-OLED has significant manufacturing challenges and low yields, hence the high prices and size limitations.<br><br>My understanding is RGB is easier. Better yields? Simpler process? Don’t know. If it can be licensed it will be and if quality is uniform prices will tumble (only to be smacked up by tariffs—but I digress). But it is still too new for anyone to know. What I gather is the tiny improvement QD-OLED leaves possible (and it is truly tiny) in color accuracy is met with RGB displays, which actually achieve 100% accuracy. They are brighter—but in practical terms that may be meaningless. They have Samsung’s second gen anti-glare display—that’s a meaningful improvement it shares with the S95F. And then there’s signal processing and AI.<br><br>The most important reason to get the S95F in my view is the best signal processing Samsung has. As I recall, the larger RGB (they’re BIG displays) have three AI processing chips to predict and (as I understand it) autofill missing pixels, smooth objects in motion while maintaining clarity, and so on. The very fact that only Samsung introduced QD-OLED initially, and (was it two years later?) then LG, and then the Chinese companies—not even close to all at once. If they were all owned by two or three mega-companies surely they would have rolled out differently, especially in Japan and China.<br><br>My very old Samsung continues to work well. But it’s picture is only HD. (Only HD! Imagine my saying that when I bought it). Even though the “smart” features suck by today’s standards they were novel when I bought it—and they supported streaming. Now the apps have aged out, the “smart” aspect all but useless. At least it has 4 HDMI ports… So I’m in the unhappy position of scrapping a perfectly functional TV to get a better TV. It’s just not right, IMO, but it is what it is.",0,0,2025-08-31T14:45:27Z

I was seriously considering this model when shopping for a new TV, but in the end I went with the LG OLED evo G5 in 83 inches instead.<br><br>A few reasons why I chose the G5:<br><br>I watch a lot of content in Dolby Vision, and since the S95F only supports HDR10(+), Dolby Vision support on the G5 was a big plus for me. The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC. The wide viewing angles and overall picture consistency just sealed the deal for my setup.<br><br>That said, the S95F is still an awesome TV, especially for bright rooms thanks to the anti-reflection treatment, and your review definitely helped me think through the strengths of each option.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light. So technically, for real world content, qd-oled  (and probably Tandem WOLED) still have higher color gamut.",1,0,2025-08-19T20:15:59Z

I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

The Samsung S95F TV looks great. However, I am a 70 year old senior citizen and I am not a gamer. I purchased my Samsung 4K OLED to watch movies and series on MAX, Starz, Amazon Prime, Netflix, MGM+, and Showtime along with Major League Baseball and the NBA. 😁",3,0,2025-09-26T14:40:42Z

A “US” car will have components made in Mexico &amp; Canada, and perhaps in Central &amp; South America and Europe &amp; Asia—but assembled in the US. And maybe not even that, these days, but the multinational origin is baked in. Mergers &amp; Aquisitions IS a fact of life—I used to work in a large brokerage firm (IT) on the same floor as our M&amp;E division. So passing brand names around? Yeah, that happens. But it isn’t an sbsolute statement of dismissal either. Sony is still Sony and Samsung is still Samsung (Panasonic was Matsushita 40+ years ago and for all I know still is, but as you observed may have been divested).<br><br>Samsung Display is the sole manufacturer of the QD-OLED display. They sell it—all over. Internally to Samsung electronics, and externally to Sony, LG, Hisense, etc. I don’t know if micro-LED has a sole manufacturing source or is licensed; the cost starting at 6 figures makes it only of academic interest to the likes of me. The new RGB displays may be a different matter as that new technology has just become commercially viable for 2026. QD-OLED has significant manufacturing challenges and low yields, hence the high prices and size limitations.<br><br>My understanding is RGB is easier. Better yields? Simpler process? Don’t know. If it can be licensed it will be and if quality is uniform prices will tumble (only to be smacked up by tariffs—but I digress). But it is still too new for anyone to know. What I gather is the tiny improvement QD-OLED leaves possible (and it is truly tiny) in color accuracy is met with RGB displays, which actually achieve 100% accuracy. They are brighter—but in practical terms that may be meaningless. They have Samsung’s second gen anti-glare display—that’s a meaningful improvement it shares with the S95F. And then there’s signal processing and AI.<br><br>The most important reason to get the S95F in my view is the best signal processing Samsung has. As I recall, the larger RGB (they’re BIG displays) have three AI processing chips to predict and (as I understand it) autofill missing pixels, smooth objects in motion while maintaining clarity, and so on. The very fact that only Samsung introduced QD-OLED initially, and (was it two years later?) then LG, and then the Chinese companies—not even close to all at once. If they were all owned by two or three mega-companies surely they would have rolled out differently, especially in Japan and China.<br><br>My very old Samsung continues to work well. But it’s picture is only HD. (Only HD! Imagine my saying that when I bought it). Even though the “smart” features suck by today’s standards they were novel when I bought it—and they supported streaming. Now the apps have aged out, the “smart” aspect all but useless. At least it has 4 HDMI ports… So I’m in the unhappy position of scrapping a perfectly functional TV to get a better TV. It’s just not right, IMO, but it is what it is.",0,0,2025-08-31T14:45:27Z

I was seriously considering this model when shopping for a new TV, but in the end I went with the LG OLED evo G5 in 83 inches instead.<br><br>A few reasons why I chose the G5:<br><br>I watch a lot of content in Dolby Vision, and since the S95F only supports HDR10(+), Dolby Vision support on the G5 was a big plus for me. The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC. The wide viewing angles and overall picture consistency just sealed the deal for my setup.<br><br>That said, the S95F is still an awesome TV, especially for bright rooms thanks to the anti-reflection treatment, and your review definitely helped me think through the strengths of each option. But for my personal use case, the G5 just checked more boxes.<br><br>Thanks again for the solid review!",3,2,2025-11-05T11:57:03Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light.

I think that&#39;s absolutely ridiculous. All of these people have grown attached to woled because people don&#39;t like change. It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;ve argued with people that said they think the white on woled looks more natural, despite the fact that that&#39;s freaking impossible. Essentially, qd-oled is capable of pure white. I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

MiniLED TVs like this still suffer from haloing with bright objects on a dark background because there is not a 1-to-1 match between backlight and each pixel.

A “US” car will have components made in Mexico &amp; Canada, and perhaps in Central &amp; South America and Europe &amp; Asia—but assembled in the US. And maybe not even that, these days, but the multinational origin is baked in. Mergers &amp; Aquisitions IS a fact of life—I used to work in a large brokerage firm (IT) on the same floor as our M&amp;E division. So passing brand names around? Yeah, that happens. But it isn’t an sbsolute statement of dismissal either. Sony is still Sony and Samsung is still Samsung (Panasonic was Matsushita 40+ years ago and for all I know still is, but as you observed may have been divested).<br><br>Samsung Display is the sole manufacturer of the QD-OLED display. They sell it—all over. Internally to Samsung electronics, and externally to Sony, LG, Hisense, etc. I don’t know if micro-LED has a sole manufacturing source or is licensed; the cost starting at 6 figures makes it only of academic interest to the likes of me. The new RGB displays may be a different matter as that new technology has just become commercially viable for 2026. QD-OLED has significant manufacturing challenges and low yields, hence the high prices and size limitations.<br><br>My understanding is RGB is easier. Better yields? Simpler process? Don’t know. If it can be licensed it will be and if quality is uniform prices will tumble (only to be smacked up by tariffs—but I digress). But it is still too new for anyone to know. What I gather is the tiny improvement QD-OLED leaves possible (and it is truly tiny) in color accuracy is met with RGB displays, which actually achieve 100% accuracy. They are brighter—but in practical terms that may be meaningless. They have Samsung’s second gen anti-glare display—that’s a meaningful improvement it shares with the S95F. And then there’s signal processing and AI.<br><br>The most important reason to get the S95F in my view is the best signal processing Samsung has. As I recall, the larger RGB (they’re BIG displays) have three AI processing chips to predict and (as I understand it) autofill missing pixels, smooth objects in motion while maintaining clarity, and so on. The very fact that only Samsung introduced QD-OLED initially, and (was it two years later?) then LG, and then the Chinese companies—not even close to all at once. If they were all owned by two or three mega-companies surely they would have rolled out differently, especially in Japan and China.<br><br>My very old Samsung continues to work well. But it’s picture is only HD. (Only HD! Imagine my saying that when I bought it). Even though the “smart” features suck by today’s standards they were novel when I bought it—and they supported streaming. Now the apps have aged out, the “smart” aspect all but useless. At least it has 4 HDMI ports… So I’m in the unhappy position of scrapping a perfectly functional TV to get a better TV. It’s just not right, IMO, but it is what it is.",0,0,2025-08-31T14:45:27Z

The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though.

wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light. So technically, for real world content, qd-oled  (and probably Tandem WOLED) still have higher color gamut.",1,0,2025-08-19T20:15:59Z

I&#39;ve argued with people that said they think the white on woled looks more natural, despite the fact that that&#39;s freaking impossible. Essentially, qd-oled is capable of pure white. I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

When Samsung and others start making televisions several years ago without the middle stand, people had to purchase a large table to put the television on. What about burn in on this television?

A “US” car will have components made in Mexico &amp; Canada, and perhaps in Central &amp; South America and Europe &amp; Asia—but assembled in the US. And maybe not even that, these days, but the multinational origin is baked in. Mergers &amp; Aquisitions IS a fact of life—I used to work in a large brokerage firm (IT) on the same floor as our M&amp;E division. So passing brand names around? Yeah, that happens. But it isn’t an sbsolute statement of dismissal either. Sony is still Sony and Samsung is still Samsung (Panasonic was Matsushita 40+ years ago and for all I know still is, but as you observed may have been divested).<br><br>Samsung Display is the sole manufacturer of the QD-OLED display. They sell it—all over. Internally to Samsung electronics, and externally to Sony, LG, Hisense, etc. I don’t know if micro-LED has a sole manufacturing source or is licensed; the cost starting at 6 figures makes it only of academic interest to the likes of me. The new RGB displays may be a different matter as that new technology has just become commercially viable for 2026. QD-OLED has significant manufacturing challenges and low yields, hence the high prices and size limitations.<br><br>My understanding is RGB is easier. Better yields? Simpler process? Don’t know. If it can be licensed it will be and if quality is uniform prices will tumble (only to be smacked up by tariffs—but I digress). But it is still too new for anyone to know. What I gather is the tiny improvement QD-OLED leaves possible (and it is truly tiny) in color accuracy is met with RGB displays, which actually achieve 100% accuracy. They are brighter—but in practical terms that may be meaningless. They have Samsung’s second gen anti-glare display—that’s a meaningful improvement it shares with the S95F. And then there’s signal processing and AI.<br><br>The most important reason to get the S95F in my view is the best signal processing Samsung has. As I recall, the larger RGB (they’re BIG displays) have three AI processing chips to predict and (as I understand it) autofill missing pixels, smooth objects in motion while maintaining clarity, and so on. The very fact that only Samsung introduced QD-OLED initially, and (was it two years later?) then LG, and then the Chinese companies—not even close to all at once. If they were all owned by two or three mega-companies surely they would have rolled out differently, especially in Japan and China.<br><br>My very old Samsung continues to work well. But it’s picture is only HD. (Only HD! Imagine my saying that when I bought it). Even though the “smart” features suck by today’s standards they were novel when I bought it—and they supported streaming. Now the apps have aged out, the “smart” aspect all but useless. At least it has 4 HDMI ports… So I’m in the unhappy position of scrapping a perfectly functional TV to get a better TV. It’s just not right, IMO, but it is what it is.",0,0,2025-08-31T14:45:27Z

I was seriously considering this model when shopping for a new TV, but in the end I went with the LG OLED evo G5 in 83 inches instead.<br><br>A few reasons why I chose the G5:<br><br>I watch a lot of content in Dolby Vision, and since the S95F only supports HDR10(+), Dolby Vision support on the G5 was a big plus for me. The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC. The wide viewing angles and overall picture consistency just sealed the deal for my setup.<br><br>That said, the S95F is still an awesome TV, especially for bright rooms thanks to the anti-reflection treatment, and your review definitely helped me think through the strengths of each option. But for my personal use case, the G5 just checked more boxes.<br><br>Thanks again for the solid review!",3,2,2025-11-05T11:57:03Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light.

I think that&#39;s absolutely ridiculous. All of these people have grown attached to woled because people don&#39;t like change. It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;ve argued with people that said they think the white on woled looks more natural, despite the fact that that&#39;s freaking impossible. Essentially, qd-oled is capable of pure white. I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

MiniLED TVs like this still suffer from haloing with bright objects on a dark background because there is not a 1-to-1 match between backlight and each pixel.

A “US” car will have components made in Mexico &amp; Canada, and perhaps in Central &amp; South America and Europe &amp; Asia—but assembled in the US. And maybe not even that, these days, but the multinational origin is baked in. Mergers &amp; Aquisitions IS a fact of life—I used to work in a large brokerage firm (IT) on the same floor as our M&amp;E division. So passing brand names around? Yeah, that happens. But it isn’t an sbsolute statement of dismissal either. Sony is still Sony and Samsung is still Samsung (Panasonic was Matsushita 40+ years ago and for all I know still is, but as you observed may have been divested).<br><br>Samsung Display is the sole manufacturer of the QD-OLED display. They sell it—all over. Internally to Samsung electronics, and externally to Sony, LG, Hisense, etc. I don’t know if micro-LED has a sole manufacturing source or is licensed; the cost starting at 6 figures makes it only of academic interest to the likes of me. The new RGB displays may be a different matter as that new technology has just become commercially viable for 2026. QD-OLED has significant manufacturing challenges and low yields, hence the high prices and size limitations.<br><br>My understanding is RGB is easier. Better yields? Simpler process? Don’t know. If it can be licensed it will be and if quality is uniform prices will tumble (only to be smacked up by tariffs—but I digress). But it is still too new for anyone to know. What I gather is the tiny improvement QD-OLED leaves possible (and it is truly tiny) in color accuracy is met with RGB displays, which actually achieve 100% accuracy. They are brighter—but in practical terms that may be meaningless. They have Samsung’s second gen anti-glare display—that’s a meaningful improvement it shares with the S95F. And then there’s signal processing and AI.<br><br>The most important reason to get the S95F in my view is the best signal processing Samsung has. As I recall, the larger RGB (they’re BIG displays) have three AI processing chips to predict and (as I understand it) autofill missing pixels, smooth objects in motion while maintaining clarity, and so on. The very fact that only Samsung introduced QD-OLED initially, and (was it two years later?) then LG, and then the Chinese companies—not even close to all at once. If they were all owned by two or three mega-companies surely they would have rolled out differently, especially in Japan and China.<br><br>My very old Samsung continues to work well. But it’s picture is only HD. (Only HD! Imagine my saying that when I bought it). Even though the “smart” features suck by today’s standards they were novel when I bought it—and they supported streaming. Now the apps have aged out, the “smart” aspect all but useless. At least it has 4 HDMI ports… So I’m in the unhappy position of scrapping a perfectly functional TV to get a better TV. It’s just not right, IMO, but it is what it is.",0,0,2025-08-31T14:45:27Z
