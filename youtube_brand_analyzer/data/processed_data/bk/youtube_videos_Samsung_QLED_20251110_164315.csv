VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung QLED,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL!

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better.

VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung QLED,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code ""SNAZZYLABS"" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of ""Frame""-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV?

They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung QLED,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code ""SNAZZYLABS"" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision.

They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything.

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

This Quantum Dot /QLED TV is also great for gamers with a high refresh rate in every single HDMI port, so you can have multiple systems hooked up to it. It’s also bright and has Samsung’s “Glare-Free” technology, so it’s great for bright rooms as well.  Are you amongst those looking for ultra-large TVs?

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung QLED,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL!

Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code ""SNAZZYLABS"" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of ""Frame""-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV?
