Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though. The regular frames were already too expensive for what they are, and I feel like we&#39;d all less harsh on these TVs if the price matched the frustration but it doesn&#39;t.",150,7,2025-09-03T12:47:42Z

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have. Palm created a world-leading operating system with webOS.,8,1,2025-11-03T15:18:59Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

Everything Quinn said in this is true. Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer. Idk if I&#39;d ever pay for the &quot;Pro&quot; version though.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer.

I actually have the S90D 42 inch and I came from a 48” C1 I noticed less aggressive ASBL (dimming w/ static elements) on the Samsung but I don’t know if that’s improved on the c5 too i imagine it did. The C5 may be a little better than the S90F 42” brightness wise from what I’ve heard. Thank you for your support btw definitely means a lot!,0,0,2025-11-08T04:47:43Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have. Palm created a world-leading operating system with webOS.,8,1,2025-11-03T15:18:59Z

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

V8UELS4di2g,UgwVvPdx95eZsAVKRk94AaABAg,top_level,,"Don&#39;t buy a Samsung QDOLED unless you know and don&#39;t care about some major caveats that come with these TV&#39;s, specially for gaming. One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks. If I were to say anything positive, it&#39;s that it can be confused for art sometimes, and it definitely makes a room feel a little nicer.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

Can&#39;t relate to the wireless portion since the Non-Pros use a cable to connect the box to the TV, but the Samsung software is atrocious, and is still not fixed. The &quot;art mode&quot; is NEVER consistent in turning on or off correctly after turning off connected devices. Software is dog-slow and Samsung is adamant on trying to make sure you pay for their art subscription for features that should be STANDARD on a TV focused on letting you display art at a premium price tag. The mounting method changed in 2022 I think? the original mount was at least long enough to get one screw onto a stud, but the new mount sucks.

LG purchased webOS from HP/Palm. That operating system is leagues above other TVs. Palm&#39;s webOS is the reason all of our iPhones and Android devices work as smoothly and helpfully as they do today. LG saw that and incorporated it into their TVs. It&#39;s the epitome of &quot;smart TV&quot;. User interface is a huge reason LG has taken as big a slice as they have.

One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models).

V8UELS4di2g,UgwVvPdx95eZsAVKRk94AaABAg,top_level,,"Don&#39;t buy a Samsung QDOLED unless you know and don&#39;t care about some major caveats that come with these TV&#39;s, specially for gaming. One of the many bad things about these TV&#39;s is that Samsung loves to destroy them with firmware updates that will download automatically even after you tell the tv not to. Another detail is that there isn&#39;t a proper HGIG implementation and nobody even knows how many nits to set it up, you will find many different numbers from experts that can range from a couple hundred nits below the actual peak brightness of the tv, to double the nits, and everyone is always sure that their numbers are the right ones. Also, the tv uses the P3 color space when in &quot;HGIG&quot; only because BT2020 is so bad, it&#39;s unusable without a professional calibration. So basically the 90% BT2020 coverage of these QDOLEDs is useless for gaming. Another problem is that every year Samsung comes up with a new bug and there is no way of knowing what it is (such as the color space bug for the 2025 models). If you are looking for a tv that will just work and you won&#39;t have to dig through forums to find how to fix it, then sadly you must look elsewhere.",0,0,2025-11-09T02:31:09Z
