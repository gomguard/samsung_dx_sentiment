VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung TV,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL!

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better.

LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

yN8o2-xivbI,Samsung TV,"MASSIVE $30,000 Samsung RGB TV! 😭","$30,000. 115 inches. Samsung’s Micro RGB is the first TV in a while where color behaves: reds don’t bloom, greens don’t wash out, and highlights keep the fine detail you paid a lot of money for. Textures stay visible, and motion doesn’t smear the moment things get busy.  In daylight the glare is minimal, and  games pick up that effortless smoothness. It’s the rare big-screen upgrade that hits hard the second you press play. @Samsung  @SamsungUS  #samsung #microrgb #hometheater #techshorts",2025-08-19T00:08:08Z,US,@andru,563000,1863,5039,124,4,28,2.5402,"댓글들은 고가의 TV에 대한 투자 가치에 대한 비판과 함께, 가격 하락을 기다리겠다는 의견이 반복적으로 나타나고 있습니다. 또한, 'holy bots'라는 표현이 여러 번 등장하며, 댓글의 일부는 특정 기술에 대한 질문을 포함하고 있습니다."

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of ""Frame""-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV? Wireless sound bar! (it's bad) 10:28 - WiFi 7 will absolutely jack up this TV 11:30 - Software is laughably bad—I've never used a worse TV 16:15 - Hardware is also bad: Apple TV issues, latency, stutter 18:42 - Samsung literally false advertised mini LED—picture quality stinks 21:27 - But this TV is about ART—so how is it?? 23:22 - ""Pro"" this TV is not—especially at night 24:04 - Do not buy this TV—it's garbage",2025-09-01T22:04:27Z,US,@snazzy,1220000,1213,720801,22363,2400,28,3.4355,"댓글들은 삼성 제품에 대한 부정적인 경험과 불만을 표현하고 있으며, 특히 가격과 성능 문제에 대한 비판이 두드러진다. 사용자들은 삼성의 업데이트와 서비스에 대한 불만을 토로하고 있으며, 전반적으로 실망감을 나타내고 있다."

VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung TV,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code ""SNAZZYLABS"" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback. If you want a main TV, buy an OLED; for an art TV, cheaper Hisense/TCL models are better. Bottom line: Samsung Frame Pro looks like wall art, but as a wireless TV it’s laggy, unreliable, and wildly overpriced.  0:00 - This is the worst TV I've ever owned 0:29 - What's the point of ""Frame""-style TVs? 2:39 - How Is It Wireless? 4:15 - Installation HELL 6:45 - eARC sound bar support is ABYSMAL 8:41 - Wireless TV?

Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

Samsung’s Micro RGB is the first TV in a while where color behaves: reds don’t bloom, greens don’t wash out, and highlights keep the fine detail you paid a lot of money for. Textures stay visible, and motion doesn’t smear the moment things get busy.  In daylight the glare is minimal, and  games pick up that effortless smoothness. It’s the rare big-screen upgrade that hits hard the second you press play. @Samsung  @SamsungUS  #samsung #microrgb #hometheater #techshorts",2025-08-19T00:08:08Z,US,@andru,563000,1863,5039,124,4,28,2.5402,"댓글들은 고가의 TV에 대한 투자 가치에 대한 비판과 함께, 가격 하락을 기다리겠다는 의견이 반복적으로 나타나고 있습니다. 또한, 'holy bots'라는 표현이 여러 번 등장하며, 댓글의 일부는 특정 기술에 대한 질문을 포함하고 있습니다."
