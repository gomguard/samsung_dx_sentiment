wLQUVIk3eR4,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg.AM0chpI24vxAM0gHXAxHVX,reply,UgzT2RmfaOYgGjKReG54AaABAg,"well he said &quot;Micro RGB.&quot; He&#39;s not the one being deceitful, it&#39;s Samsung Electronics. &quot;Micro RGB&quot; is just a marketing term, whereas Micro LED is the industry accepted term for a self emissive panel consisting of LEDs. I agree though, super deceitful. &quot;Micro&quot; usually refers to 1/1,000,000 of a meter, also known as a Micron. In other words, I&#39;m assuming the width of individual subpixels in a MicroLED display are within a size that scientists would consider &quot;Micro Scale?&quot; Actually, there are MicroLED panels with LEDs that are technically not Micro Scale. So yea, using the term &quot;Micro,&quot; is pretty freaking misleading. I guarentee this display is an RGB backlit mini LED LCD. Vincent Teoh, of HDTVTest, recently tested the color gamut of Hisense&#39;s RGB mini led, and found it only covered 93% of BT2020. That is extremely impressive, but I heavily doubt this panel will be able to reach 100% of BT2020. Also, those measurements are done when the whole entire screen is a uniform color. The reason that QLED televisions only achieve around 80% bt2020 coverage is because the color filters aren&#39;t perfect, and since they are filtering their respective color from white light, and not all of the &#39;undesired&quot; light gets filtered, each subpixel is &quot;polluted,&quot; which hinders the display&#39;s color purity. This doesn&#39;t happen with RGB mini led because the backlight doesn&#39;t just consist of white light (mixture of blue LEDs with red and green quantum dot layer). If you want red to be displayed, the backlight just emits red. The problem is, when there are tons of different colors right next to each other, the backlight is going to have to send a mixture of those colors, and depend on the color filters to do the rest. An OLED display doesn&#39;t have this problem since each individual subpixel provides it&#39;s own light. So technically, for real world content, qd-oled  (and probably Tandem WOLED) still have higher color gamut.",1,0,2025-08-19T20:15:59Z

I&#39;ve argued with people that said they think the white on woled looks more natural, despite the fact that that&#39;s freaking impossible. Essentially, qd-oled is capable of pure white. I know it&#39;s not the same as the pure white from the sun, but due to the way our eyes work, it&#39;s effectively pure white. At least much more pleasing than the white from Woled which still has an ugly green tint. The black level raise is unfortunate, but the color purity of qd-oled easily makes up for it.

d0KpULFsHxU,UgzcVsR3ew-0Ua7XJ4t4AaABAg,top_level,,I like how the S95F has the matte anti-reflective coating that can do an incredible job reducing the glare from windows or lights to the point that they&#39;re barely even visible. I&#39;d eventually like to have one in 65&quot; or 83&quot; size but I had to settle with an LG G5 77&quot; OLED evo AI for now since I found a good deal on fb marketplace and got one brand new in the box for $1000 bucks.

I was seriously considering this model when shopping for a new TV, but in the end I went with the LG OLED evo G5 in 83 inches instead.<br><br>A few reasons why I chose the G5:<br><br>I watch a lot of content in Dolby Vision, and since the S95F only supports HDR10(+), Dolby Vision support on the G5 was a big plus for me. The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC. The wide viewing angles and overall picture consistency just sealed the deal for my setup.<br><br>That said, the S95F is still an awesome TV, especially for bright rooms thanks to the anti-reflection treatment, and your review definitely helped me think through the strengths of each option. But for my personal use case, the G5 just checked more boxes.<br><br>Thanks again for the solid review!",3,2,2025-11-05T11:57:03Z

Nothing wrong with the W version and it&#39;s still a good tv with nice dark to light contrasts but it might stuggle to be as bright as QLED/LCD tvs but nothing a dark room can&#39;t fix and again it&#39;s just old-ish tech compared to what&#39;s out there right now.",0,0,2025-09-07T23:40:24Z

d8GqHIa6gjU,UgzkMhdkemP055OVMod4AaABAg,top_level,,"Something reviews never consider is longevity from quality internal components. Samsung&#39;s superior quality to TCL, HiSense, etc., means those TVs will last years longer/thousands of hours longer. That&#39;s a big consideration for me. I had a Samsung that was outstanding for 15 years before giving it away, my sister had a Vizio that suffered black screen of death in 5 years. So if you think those up-and-coming brands represent better value-- unless you are cool with replacing sets every 10 years or less-- think again. Sure, the tech improves, it continually imlroves. But when you&#39;ve been watching the same TV set for 10 years, you just don&#39;t care about that. (Now if we are talking OLED TVs then you have to cut that expectation for duration by a third compared to LED/QLED sets.)",9,4,2025-10-20T12:05:52Z

I Have had my TCL for 2 years and it still looks perfect. I think people tend to buy Samsung for the name. Most of their lcd screens look not that great for the price and feature set imo. And as a brand they are NOT the same as they were 10+ years ago. The oled screens are nice though. I had a 2011 samsung that had amazing picture and it developed a flickering line 13 years later so I replaced it with another samsung.  And the picture was absolute trash and it had tons of DSE/ backlight bleed etc. Swapped it for a different model which had the same issues. Got the TCL after that and have been very happy with it.  Perfect uniformity. Very little DSE. Side note but My parents have had a Vizio since 2013 and picture is still perfect also. So it just depends I guess?,0,0,2025-10-22T03:02:16Z

Remember those big monitors. If you find one, put it&#39;s screen under a magnifying glass, simple one. Every strip is made of hundreds of sections laid out in a vertical line. So each of these sections is further divided into RGB(The Red Green Blue Dot) yes, that was the original RGB Dot.<br>After all this talk of going digital, the technique for constructing new technology remains the same as the one invented, what 70-75 years ago? We don&#39;t have anything new. If the technique is old, then I&#39;ll bet anything, that it&#39;s a old age pig with a modern lipstick, what I don&#39;t get is why they&#39;re charging 30,000 dollars for something that isn&#39;t even a newer concept.

BEAOVJvkUWI,Ugw9qhXpTqOnLZqL46Z4AaABAg,top_level,,"Some points that need to be noted:<br>1. Of the premium segments, Mini-LEDs offer higher brightness and color volume whereas OLEDs offer better viewing angles and contrast.<br>2. OLEDs tend to suffer a higher rate of Burn-In in hotter areas (more than 40 degrees), so if you are planning to buy a premium TV, and you are from such an area and your living room does not have AC, go for a Mini-LED TV instead of OLED.<br>3. If your budget do not allow for you to get a higher tier version of latest model, go for last year model of that tier, like if Samsung QN90F (2025) is out of budget, opt for QN90D (2024). Yes QN85F (2025) has some features that looks on paper better than QN90D, but 90 series is a higher tier than 85, as such will have more local-dimming zones and better HDR management (in some cases) and so on, which results in better experience. This cannot be followed when choosing mid-range TVs, as the upgrades year-on-year is greater in those segments.<br>4. Hisense Q series, TCL C series are extremely good deals which offer Samsung Mini-LED QLED and Sony Mini-LED levels of performance at lower price bracket. But their other ranges are things to be debated.",6,1,2025-10-08T06:09:35Z
