Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide.

Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

VvI0TtwsqX0,Samsung QLED,Samsung’s Wireless Frame Pro TV Is a Disaster (And I’m Stuck With It),"Samsung's new $2,200 Wireless Frame Pro TV is AWFUL! Watch it implode under latency, bugs, and edge‑lit lies. Save on the Rhinoshield AirX at checkout using code ""SNAZZYLABS"" - https://url.rhinoshield.io/SNAZZYLABS Follow Snazzy Labs on Twitter - https://twitter.com/snazzylabs   Follow me on Bluesky - https://snazzy.fm/UW Follow me on Threads - https://snazzy.fm/XV Follow me on Mastodon - https://snazzy.fm/NN Follow me on Instagram - https://instagram.com/snazzyq  In this Samsung Frame Pro review, I explain why the $2,200 “wireless” TV is a disaster: the Wireless One Connect box causes latency, stutters, and constant disconnects, the micro‑HDMI 2.1 port lacks eARC/ARC for soundbars, Wi‑Fi 7/6GHz interference breaks stability, and HDMI‑CEC mangles Art Mode power behavior. Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

m_LCI2rFDUY,Samsung QLED,The Unstoppable Rise Of LG TVs (There's No Catching Up),"💡 Turn any idea into a production-ready app or website by describing it to AI. Dream it, and Lindy builds it from coding to QA. Try Lindy today using my link 👉🏻 https://go.lindy.ai/logically-answered   In the early 2010s, OLED was a joke. Too fragile, too expensive, and impossible to scale. Everyone dropped it except LG. Fast forward to today, and LG owns over half the global OLED market. They even make panels for Samsung and Sony. So what did LG see that everyone else missed? Back in the 2000s, the TV world was all Plasma and LCD. Plasma had the best picture but came with heat, power, and burn-in issues. LCDs were cheap, efficient, and “good enough.” While everyone chased scale, LG doubled down on quality. They bought Kodak’s OLED patents, poured billions into R&D, and invented WRGB OLED to cut costs. For years, it looked like financial suicide. But when Netflix, gaming, and home theaters exploded, OLED became the gold standard. By 2016, LG had perfected manufacturing, and by 2017, the C7 OLED changed everything. Competitors mocked OLED, then bought LG panels anyway. Now, LG Display supplies Samsung, Sony, and nearly every major brand. The bet no one believed in became the tech no one could live without.

Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.

Despite the matte panel and convincing Art Mode, the edge‑lit “Neo QLED powered by mini‑LED” display delivers poor contrast, vertical banding, smeary night scenes, and unhinged default picture settings—with no Dolby Vision. Software is painfully slow (TV Plus bloat), setup is infuriating (mounting/stud issues, cable routing), and even Samsung’s S801D soundbar drops audio over Wi‑Fi, forcing a lower‑quality Bluetooth fallback.
