As for as Sony if you have the money or want to spend too much. When you get a little less, same, or better for cheaper.  You must really  love Sony.

Anyone looking to buy a 2025 Samsung QLED tv needs to watch this!! 🎉 <br>Also, having just experienced the power board die on my $1600 65qn90C after only 22 months, ANYONE buying a Samsung tv, I STRONGLY suggest getting an extended warranty!!  If you go Samsung OLED, the power board may go out within the 1 year warranty but I still suggest if spending over $1499, get an extended warranty or buy from Costco etc!! 🎉",1,0,2025-11-10T00:31:58Z
UkBS6gzxiRI,UgxrVWraPMRm9KLEqYp4AaABAg,top_level,,I like my c5 better than my S95c for some reason..like color and that kind of thing. Also My Samsung only lasted 2 years and the power went out on the thing and the repair guy said I’d be expensive to fix. I was dumb not getting a warranty but I never had any tv I didn’t knock over my self die like that either hehe. Reading up on it it seems the power supply issue is fairly common and those one connection boxes cause a lot of problems,2,0,2025-11-09T18:21:38Z

d0KpULFsHxU,UgzcVsR3ew-0Ua7XJ4t4AaABAg,top_level,,I like how the S95F has the matte anti-reflective coating that can do an incredible job reducing the glare from windows or lights to the point that they&#39;re barely even visible. I&#39;d eventually like to have one in 65&quot; or 83&quot; size but I had to settle with an LG G5 77&quot; OLED evo AI for now since I found a good deal on fb marketplace and got one brand new in the box for $1000 bucks. I could barely afford that at the time after getting the water pump on my car replaced but it was well worth it coming from the 43&quot; to 46&quot; range.,1,0,2025-11-07T04:45:49Z
d0KpULFsHxU,Ugzq-ymvKFdewMim6J14AaABAg,top_level,,"Just changed my 55S90D for the 55S95F! We recently moved and the tv is in a game room/office. The S95F looks amazing in this bright office and even at night. Loved the S90D but the glare was annoying in my environment. I have grown to love the anti glare coating. In the loft, we have the 77S95D.",1,0,2025-11-04T16:27:02Z
d0KpULFsHxU,Ugxwy9WQqKBlW546wFp4AaABAg,top_level,,"Great review of the Samsung S95F, really appreciate the detailed breakdown! I was seriously considering this model when shopping for a new TV, but in the end I went with the LG OLED evo G5 in 83 inches instead.<br><br>A few reasons why I chose the G5:<br><br>I watch a lot of content in Dolby Vision, and since the S95F only supports HDR10(+), Dolby Vision support on the G5 was a big plus for me. The 83-inch size also made the decision easier, since LG’s panel in that size delivers excellent uniformity, brightness, and black levels for movie-watching in a darker room. On top of that, having HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and very low input lag was huge, as I game on both console and PC. The wide viewing angles and overall picture consistency just sealed the deal for my setup.<br><br>That said, the S95F is still an awesome TV, especially for bright rooms thanks to the anti-reflection treatment, and your review definitely helped me think through the strengths of each option. But for my personal use case, the G5 just checked more boxes.<br><br>Thanks again for the solid review!",3,2,2025-11-05T11:57:03Z
